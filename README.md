user_auth_warmup

feel free to fork and clone this repo for the rest of the week's warmups

To use locally:
npm install
createdb users_db
knex migrate:latest
knex seed: run

--If this doesn't work, let me know.

To start nodemon, just use 'npm start' in terminal... I changed the "start" to use nodemon instead of node.
